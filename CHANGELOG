* Removed 'crop:' option as already included when prefixing geometry with a 'c'.  Add note to docs.
* Added option to sharpen resized images ':sharpen_on_resize'
* Removed old init code that causes a asset:precompile error for sprockets (per https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6989)

* Oct 26, 2012 *
* Merged with https://github.com/tdd/attachment_fu fork to include GEM support for use in Rails 3.2, and bumped version to 3.2.x to indicate Rails 3.2 support.

* Fix to support Ruby 1.9.3
* Image cropping support (append 'crop:' to desired file size when resizing)

* Mar 15, 2010 *
* Added a symbol syntax for parent-type-based size spec: calls the corresponding method on the current asset instance to
  get a Hash of required thumbnails.  Lets us dynamically specify what would otherwise be hard-coded, which is useful
  when the set of thumbnails for a given parent type varies depending on the usage context.

* JPEG quality control finalized across processors (although CoreImage applies it in a rather fuzzy-logic way), with tests.

* Aug 4, 2009 *
* Supports the :aspect/'!' geometry flag in all processors
  (thanks to http://www.deepcalm.com/writing/cropped-thumbnails-in-attachment_fu-using-imagescience)
* JPEG quality control on thumbnailing/resizing (still buggy on Rmagick/MiniMagick though).
* Moves from GIF to PNG regardless of the source file extension's case (used to require lowercase)
* Auto-orients image (if EXIF suggests it) prior to processing with RMagickProcessor
* Fixes non-image upload tests (both regular files and Merb files)
* Fixes obsolete failures on RMagick tests (aspect_ratio tested but not initialized anymore due to new callback architecture
