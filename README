S3 Tests
========

By default, the s3 tests get skipped unless your config file exists.  Create
a spec/s3.yml file resembling this:

# Running a local s3 clone called Parkplace
# http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/parkPlaceTheS3CloneYouVeBeenAlwaysAlmostWantingToSaveFifteenCentsWith.html
# Works with amazon if you want to be charged for running specs.  Yikes!
